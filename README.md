Crime Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing crime data in Chicago, utilizing various data science techniques to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement machine learning algorithms for crime prediction. The analysis is performed using Jupyter notebooks and includes the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-analysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd crime-analysis

# Install the required packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Use the Data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to clean and prepare the crime data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use the chicago-crime-EDA.ipynb notebook to perform EDA on the crime data, which includes visualizations and statistical analysis to understand crime patterns.

Machine Learning Models: Use the KNN_Algo.ipynb and RandomForestModel.ipynb notebooks to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting crime. The KNN algorithm notebook explores crime prediction using the K-Nearest Neighbors method, while the Random Forest notebook uses the Random Forest algorithm for predictions.
